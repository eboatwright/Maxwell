# Maxwell Chess Engine
 My Chess engine named Maxwell, written in Rust!<br>
 View the code at your own discretion, it's very messy<br><br>
 If you do use this code verbatim, or as reference, please credit me!

# DISCLAIMER
 I have the engine thinking for 30 seconds per move, if you have a slow computer,
 it's not going to have enough time to calculate at a decent depth, therefore making it weaker.<br>
 (I'm on a 2012 Macbook Pro that's running Ubuntu 22.04 Linux, so anything newer than that is great)
