For X - Y - Z the order is: Wins, Losses, Draws
Time controls I usually use: 30+0.5, 10+0.2, or 8+0.1

	Techincally a win, but the scores were fluctuating a good bit, and I'm not so sure about it


v12 vs v11 was equal, because v12 was just a bit of code cleanup

Countermoves vs Re-write v15: 122 - 177 - 201


v16 changed TT to use a Vec instead of a HashMap, so there should be no strength difference
