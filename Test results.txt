For X - Y - Z the order is: Wins, Losses, Draws
I used to use 30+0.5 and 10+0.2, but lately I've been using 8+0.08

Don't allow more than one null move in the search tree at once vs Re-write v11: 175 - 167 - 268
	Techincally a win, but the scores were fluctuating a good bit, and I'm not so sure about it


v12 vs v11 was equal, because v12 was just a bit of code cleanup


Strelka razoring vs Re-write v12: 234 - 304 - 368


NMP changes (> 1, and 3 + (depth - 2) / 5) vs Re-write v12: 255 - 254 - 391

Countermoves vs Re-write v15: 122 - 177 - 201


v16 changed TT to use a Vec instead of a HashMap, so there should be no strength difference


Re-write v17 (Re-wrote killer moves) vs Re-write v16: 173 - 122 - 205


Re-write v17 vs Maxwell v3.0.8 (Patch 2): 968 - 136 - 476 (1580 games, and an estimated +190 Elo!!)


Count plies since null moves in is_repetition vs Re-write v17: 140 - 149 - 211

Incremental move sorter like Rustic vs Re-write v19: 153 - 171 - 176


Extensions outside the move loop vs Re-write v19: 576 - 581 - 593


Only check extension, outside the move loop vs Re-write v19: 272 - 276 - 252


Re-write v20 (Rewrote extension code) vs Re-write v19: 171 - 163 - 166


(Re-write v20's RFP Threshold is 60 centipawns per ply)
RFP = 80 vs Re-write v20:  165 - 172 - 173
RFP = 90 vs Re-write v20:  168 - 181 - 151
RFP = 100 vs Re-write v20: 423 - 519 - 508

At this point I changed RFP to return beta (because of fail hard)

RFP = 16 * (depth - 1).pow(2) + 50 vs Re-write v20: 196 - 217 - 191
RFP = 30 * (depth - 1).pow(2) + 60 vs Re-write v20: 133 - 150 - 176
RFP = 20 * (depth - 1).pow(2) + 65 vs Re-write v20: 140 - 163 - 147
RFP = 40 * (depth - 1).pow(2) + 70 vs Re-write v20: 486 - 498 - 516

FINALLY
Re-write v21 (RFP = 50 * (depth - 1).pow(2) + 55) vs Re-write v20: 276 - 252 - 272


Hmm
Store Alpha bound TT entries vs Re-write v21: 283 - 308 - 311


No TT Cutoff on PV-nodes vs Re-write v21: 514 - 521 - 573


Internal Iterative Reductions
	Only on PV, Depth > 2, Depth -= 1 vs Re-write v21: 254 - 255 - 253
	Re-write v22 (All nodes, Depth > 1, Depth -= 1) vs Re-write v21: 285 - 234 - 247
	All nodes, Depth > 2, Depth -= 2 vs Re-write v22: It lost horribly :P


Only return TT eval if not PV, or depth == 0 vs Re-write v22: 498 - 554 - 618


RFP = 55 * (depth - 1).pow(2) + 60 vs Re-write v22: 142 - 145 - 153

Razoring change (threshold <= alpha) vs Re-write v22: 122 - 132 - 146
Razoring change (285 + 200 * (depth - 1)) vs Re-write v22: 205 - 198 - 207
Razoring change (300 + 150 * (depth - 1)) vs Re-write v22: 265 - 225 - 266
